## 🧠 Project Overview

This simulation consisted of two main analytic tasks:

### 1. **Manufacturing Downtime Analysis | Tableau**
- Developed an interactive **Tableau dashboard** to analyse machine downtime by device and factory
- Designed KPI indicators for total downtime and highest downtime device
- Visualized insights to highlight operational bottlenecks

### 2. **Gender Pay Equality Classification | Excel**
- Used logical functions in **Microsoft Excel** to classify roles based on equality scores
- Applied structured rules to label scores as *Fair*, *Unfair*, or *Highly Discriminative*
- Implemented a formula leveraging `IF()` and `ABS()` functions for consistent classification
