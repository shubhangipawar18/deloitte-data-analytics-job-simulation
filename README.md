# Deloitte Australia – Data Analytics Virtual Job Simulation

This repository contains my completed project work for the **Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program (Forage)**.

The simulation focused on real-world business analysis, dashboard development, and forensic data classification.

## 📊 Project Summary

The simulation included two core analytical tasks:

---

### 🔹 Task 1: Manufacturing Downtime Analysis (Tableau)

**Objective:** Identify operational bottlenecks across devices and factories.

- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing machine downtime
- Designed KPI cards for:
  - Total Downtime
  - Highest Downtime Device
- Used bar visualizations to compare downtime across factories
- Structured layout using containers for clean executive presentation
- Delivered insights highlighting production inefficiencies

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Classification (Excel – Forensic Analysis)

**Objective:** Classify job roles based on equality scores to assess pay fairness.

- Processed compensation data across factories
- Created a new “Equality Class” column using logical conditions
- Implemented classification logic using:

```excel
=IF(ABS(C2)<=10,"Fair",IF(ABS(C2)<=20,"Unfair","Highly Discriminative"))

## Applied structured thresholds:

±10 → Fair

±20 → Unfair

Beyond ±20 → Highly Discriminative

Delivered consistent and rule-based classification output
