## 📊 Project Summary

The simulation included two core analytical tasks:

---

### 🔹 Task 1: Manufacturing Downtime Analysis (Tableau)

**Objective:** Identify operational bottlenecks across devices and factories.

- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing machine downtime
- Designed KPI cards for:
  - Total Downtime
  - Highest Downtime Device
- Used bar visualizations to compare downtime across factories
- Structured layout using containers for clean executive presentation
- Delivered insights highlighting production inefficiencies

Key Insight:
LaserWelder and LaserCutter accounted for the majority of total downtime, indicating targeted maintenance strategies could significantly improve operational efficiency.

### 🔹 Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Classification (Excel – Forensic Analysis)

**Objective:** Classify job roles based on equality scores to assess pay fairness.

- Processed compensation data across factories
- Created a new “Equality Class” column using logical conditions
- Implemented classification logic using:

 =IF(ABS(C2)<=10,"Fair",
   IF(ABS(C2)<=20,"Unfair",
   "Highly Discriminative"))




📌 Applied structured thresholds:

±10 → Fair

±20 → Unfair

Beyond ±20 → Highly Discriminative

Delivered consistent and rule-based classification output


Key Insight:
Certain senior management roles exhibited highly discriminatory equality scores, suggesting potential structural pay imbalance requiring HR policy review.
